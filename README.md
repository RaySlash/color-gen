# Color Generator | by RaySlash
This website is my rice website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main intention of the website would be to give the use a rgba() values and
a random muted color with the range of red, green and blue as a value of 100. This can be changed by updating the values of var intensity in 
the javascript file.
